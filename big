#processes, and how many processes the currently logged in user is
#running

#Set var USR

#Find process with the most Memory Usage
tmp2=`ps aux -m | sed '2!d' | cut -c 78-`

#Find how many users are running active processes
tmp3=`ps aux | cut -c 1-11 | sort | uniq | wc -l;`

#Find how many processes the currently logged in user is using
